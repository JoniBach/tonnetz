\[
\text{Pitch}(q, r; \text{root}) = (\text{root} + 7q + 4r) \bmod 12
\]
Definitions

(q, r) = integer lattice coordinates (two independent directions in the hex grid)

root = pitch class of the origin (0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, …, 11 = B)

7 = semitone offset for moving one step in the “fifths” direction (perfect fifth = +7 semitones)

4 = semitone offset for moving one step in the “major third” direction (major third = +4 semitones)

The implicit third direction (q − r) corresponds to minor thirds (7 − 4 = 3 semitones)
